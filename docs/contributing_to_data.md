## Games

Annotating fields with an URL to a source can help future contributors. Do not
do this with every piece of data, for example, we don't need links to RemyWiki.
Only add comments for data that can be a bit tricky to find.

- `publisher`: Fill only if they make multiple games. Leaving empty for indie
  games create less clutter.
- `end`: If the latest entry was a live service, such as an arcade game, use the
  termination date. Otherwise (ie. most console games), use the release date of
  the latest game.
